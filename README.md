# Goal
1: Show how to 'pick' random paths using a cards   
2: Show how to vectorize those paths   
3: Show how to compare those vectors   
4: Discuss why that is nice  
5: First using 'cards' and next use a slightly less simple dataset with more dimensions to show how powerful vecoriztion is   

# TODO
1: Vecorize 
2: Less dummy example   
3: Silly line graph
